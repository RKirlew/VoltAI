**Talk to report an incident. AI analyzes it, maps it, and alerts the right responders.**

VoltAI is an AI-powered incident intake system designed for utility and infrastructure incidents. Instead of filling out forms or calling overloaded dispatch centers, users simply **speak**. VoltAI listens, understands, structures the report, and turns it into actionable data in real time.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Utility and infrastructure incidents (downed power lines, gas leaks, sparks, fires) are often:
- Reported verbally with incomplete or inconsistent details
- Delayed by manual intake and triage
- Hard to visualize and prioritize in real time

This slows response times when **minutes matter**.

---

## 💡 The Solution

VoltAI acts as an **autonomous AI intake coordinator**:

- Users report incidents by voice
- AI asks clarifying questions automatically
- The incident is structured, summarized, and classified
- Severity is inferred
- The incident appears instantly on a live map
- The right teams are informed without manual handoff

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

-  **Utility companies** (power, gas, water)
- **Field operations & dispatch teams**
- **Municipal incident reporting**
-  **After-hours or overflow call handling**
-  **Replacing or augmenting 311 / emergency intake**

---

## ✨ Features

-  **Browser-based voice reporting**
-  **AI-driven conversational intake**
-  **Automatic transcription & summarization**
-  **Incident severity classification**
-  **Live map with incident markers**
- **Structured incident records (ready for ops workflows)**
-  **Autonomous confirmation & routing logic**
